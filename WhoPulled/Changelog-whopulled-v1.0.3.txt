V1.0.3 Release
* Added GUI options, found in Interface/Addons panel.
* Added "Devout Follower" from final boss in Stonecore and many critters found in dungeons to the default ignore list.
* Changed how the ignore list saves it's data.  Mobs are not case-sensitive anymore.
* Added code to merge an old ignore list with the new.

* Known bug:  /wp sometimes doesn't bring up the options panel depending on what addons are loaded.  No way that I'm using a variable or function name as another addon, so no idea why. I give up for now.  Use it if it works for you.

V1.0 Release
* Fixed global 'this' issue caused by patch 4.0.1.
* Fixed cross-server issues.
* Added code for automatic MainTank detection in raid groups.
* Added automatic tank detection in LFD groups. No need to use /wp tanks Tanker-Servername anymore, though that command is still there and still adds anyone marked as tank to the list with whoever you say is tanking.
* Changed format of tanks. Using the example from above, they can be added with or without the spaces between name and server, as long as the dash is there.
/wp tanks Panzer,Steam-Khaz Modan,Sideswiper
OR
/wp tanks Panzer Steam - Khaz Modan Sideswiper
It will still recognize Panzer, Sideswiper, and Steam - Khaz Modan
